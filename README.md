# GraphHaskell
Graph representation and algorithm implementation for educational purpose
* We use stateful computation concept for implementing Graph.
## Graph Representation
- Vertex List and Edge List
- Adjacency List
  - Update Adjacency List Graph
## Graph Construction
- Add/Reomve Vertex(s)
- Add/Remove Edge(s)
## Graph Properties
- Contain Vertex
- Contain Edge
## Graph Algorithm
- Depth First Search
